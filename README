dtrace, a node.js addon for controlling DTrace enablings
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple (and, for the moment, crude) addon to provide native
libdtrace to node.js programs, supporting basic enablings (including
aggregations).  Currently, esoteric actions are not supported -- this is
not designed to allow a drop-in replacement for dtrace(1).
