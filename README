dtrace, a node.js addon for controlling DTrace enablings
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple (and, for the moment, crude) addon to provide native
libdtrace to node.js programs.  Currently, only the most basic DTrace
enablings are supported -- it doesn't support rather major functionality
like aggregations and error handling.
